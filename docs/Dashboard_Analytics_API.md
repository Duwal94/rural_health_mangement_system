# Dashboard Analytics API Documentation

## Overview

The Dashboard Analytics API provides comprehensive statistical insights for the Rural Health Management System. It offers two main endpoints:

1. **System-wide Analytics** (Public) - Statistics across all clinics
2. **Clinic-specific Analytics** (Protected) - Statistics for a specific clinic

## Routes

### 1. System-wide Dashboard Analytics

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/dashboard/analytics`

```

### 2. Clinic-specific Dashboard Analytics

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/portal/staff/dashboard/analytics`
**Access**: Protected (Clinic Staff only)
**Authorization**: `Bearer TOKEN`
**Description**: Returns comprehensive analytics for the authenticated clinic

**Alternative Endpoints** (same functionality):
- `GET /api/v1/portal/medical/dashboard/analytics` (Doctors and Nurses)

#### Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer <clinic_staff_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Response Format

Same as system-wide analytics but filtered for the specific clinic. The `overall_stats.total_clinics` will always be 1, and `district_analytics` will be empty.

## Example Usage

### cURL Examples

#### Get System-wide Analytics
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/dashboard/analytics" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Get Clinic-specific Analytics
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/portal/staff/dashboard/analytics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### JavaScript/Fetch Examples

#### Get System-wide Analytics
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/dashboard/analytics');
const analytics = await response.json();
console.log('System Analytics:', analytics);
```

#### Get Clinic-specific Analytics
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/portal/staff/dashboard/analytics', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const analytics = await response.json();
console.log('Clinic Analytics:', analytics);
```

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- All patient data is anonymized and aggregated
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed
- Statistics are calculated in real-time from the database

### Access Control
- System-wide analytics: Public access (for research and policy making)
- Clinic-specific analytics: Protected by role-based authentication
- Clinic staff can only access their own clinic's data

### Rate Limiting
- Consider implementing rate limiting for public endpoints
- Cache results for better performance

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Complex aggregation queries may be slow on large datasets
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexes on date fields recommended

### Recommended Optimizations
1. Add database indexes on `visit_date`, `clinic_id`, `diagnosis_code`
2. Implement Redis caching for analytics results
3. Consider pre-calculating common statistics
4. Use database views for complex aggregations

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

#### 401 Unauthorized (for protected endpoints)
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized access"
}
```

#### 500 Internal Server Error
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to fetch analytics data"
}
```

#### 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "error": "Clinic not found"
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live analytics
- **Custom Date Ranges**: Allow filtering by custom date ranges
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export of analytics data
- **Comparative Analytics**: Compare clinic performance metrics
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning for health trend prediction

### API Versioning
Current version: `v1`
Future versions will maintain backward compatibility.
